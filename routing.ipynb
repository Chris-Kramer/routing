    "In my humble opinion Integer Linear Programming (ILP) is a critically under rated tool for data scientist. Rather than only looking at problems from a predictive (machine learning) or descriptive (statistics) perspective, this tool allows us look at a problem from a presciptive postion and actually propose optimal solutions. In this little notebook, I want to showcase how Integer Linear Programming, can be used to solve real world problems. "

    "Note, that this is not a comprehensive introduction, but just a quick primer. In short, ILP is a method for proposing the optimal solution for a problem. This problem takes the form of   $Ax \\leq b$ where $A$ is a $m × n$ matrix, $x$ is a $n × 1$ matrix, and b is a $m × 1$  and where the solution only contains integers.\n",

Heuristics are algorithms, which provides solutions with lower computational complexity, but solutions that are *near* optimal rather than optimal.  "
